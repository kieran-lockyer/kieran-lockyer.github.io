## Part One

### Purpose
The purpose of my portfolio website is to portray my unique story, personality and skills to potential employers in a professional and creative manner.

### Functionality and Features
My portfolio has 3 main sections that tell the user about me. About, Work & Study and Projects.

It also links to my Linkedin and Github profiles, as well as showing coding languages I'm comfortable with.

My own personal logo is present at the top of the page.

I have 3 main animation elements incorporated into my portfolio:
- My logo spins when loading the page, and when hovering a mouse over, or clicking on mobile.
- The background slowly moves diagonally across the screen.
- The text and image fields grow when moused over or clicked on mobile.

### Site Map
- index.html (This is a single page site.)

### Target Audience
Professional coders, hiring managers at software companies and tech industry recruiters.

### Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS

### Design Planning
I wanted to create a clean and colourful portfolio site that shows some creativity whilst displaying proficiency at code and provide some insight into my personality.

### Mood Board
On my mood board I included some screenshots of the game "Monument Valley" and the YouTube channel Kurzgesagt as I really like their design and colour choices. I also included a picture of my favourite socks which feature an optical illusion print.

### Wireframes
I started with pen and paper while designing my websites layout, then moved to Adobe Illustrator to create finalised wireframes.

### Colour Pallettes
I wanted muted colours on my site with accents to direct users towards key information.

### Font Selections
As most of the elements on my site comprised of straight edges, I wanted to pick a san-serif font that had some curviness to contrast with the rest of my site. I chose 'Righteous' as a font as I instantly liked it when I first saw it and it met the criteria I was after. Instead of using multiple fonts, I used the one with different sizes and emphasis to differentiate headings from the main body of text.

### Accessibility
I used Color Oracle (https://colororacle.org/) to apply different filters to my chosen colour scheme to help design the layout in the most user friendly way. While there is a section that is hard to read with Protanopia, it is still readable so I stuck with it.

### Project Management
I used Agile methodologies in completing this project, making extensive use of Github and Trello to keep track of development progress, and integrating completed features. I made sure to categories stories by time and difficulty to implement vs importance of the feature.

I gave myself a deadline to have completed the site by Friday 21st September, so there would be plenty of time left over for documentation, and creating the presentation. This deadline was achieved.

### Bugs
- Background animation resets to a position slightly different to where it finishes, causing the screen to jump. As I like the scrolling direction more than the glitch bugs me, I'm choosing to keep it in as it only happens once every 60 seconds.

## Part Two

### Development of the Internet
Early 80’s - Government run networks with restricted access for universities and corporations for research purposes, the most notable being ARPANET.

Late 80’s - ARPANET hands over to NSFNET as backbone of the internet. Companies connect people to standalone networks. First ISP’s launch in 1989, connecting consumers to the internet.

Mid 90’s - WWW and HTTP reinvents connecting and navigating the Internet. NSFNET closed down, control handed to ISP’s. Dial-up internet is most prevalent method to get online, connecting over existing phone lines. Top speeds of 56kbps. Around 100,000 websites existed.

2000’s - DSL and Cable increase speeds dramatically. Richer content is available and data centres become key to processing data, and serving tailored content to individuals. Cloud computing becomes feasible. Mobile internet usage becomes ubiquitous.

2010’s - SaaS, PaaS and IaaS become popular to deliver services online. IoT connects many more devices. Algorithms and big data shape how people interact with the internet.


### Elements of the Internet and How They Interact

Packets - Chunks of data that have been split for transmission.

Internet Protocol Suite - Protocols like TCP, IP that govern how packets are formatted, transmitted, addressed and secured.

IP address - A unique number assigned by an ISP or web host, acts like a postal address.

Domain - An alternate name for an IP address which is readily memorisable.

DNS - A directory that stores domain names and their associated IP address.

Web Host - A company that hosts web pages and contents on servers for a fee. Provides 
IP addresses to website owners.

Web Server - Software that processes requests and serves content to clients.

Router - Direct packets through the Internet from intersections where different networks meet.

ISP - A company that sells access to the Internet, provides IP addresses for users and routes part of the traffic between the user and the Internet.

Web browser - Software that retrieves and displays content on a users screen.

### Aspect of the Internet

One of the most important and impactful elements of the Internet is the search engine. In the beginning users where limited to websites that they already knew how to find, or could guess how to access. 

The earliest search engines were merely lists of websites sorted by category. More modern search engines utilise “spiders”, bots that trawl the internet and collect data to a search index, with various algorithms used to rank which websites will be listed at the top when you run a search. 

This has been a game changer and has unlocked the full potential of the internet. However, search engine companies have been questioned about how much data they need to deliver good search results, and if there should be restrictions placed for privacy as companies have begun serving targeted ads, content based on personal info like political alignment and eavesdrop on conversations with modern smartphones.
